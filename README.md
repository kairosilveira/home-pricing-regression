In this project a create a model to predict house prices using machine learning. A lot of steps of a data science were applied, such as:

- Business Understanding
  - Understand what is the company's demand
  - Define the type of taks is going to be performed
  - Define what metrics use

- Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Extraction of insights
  - Analyse distributions and transformations
  - Analyse the relationship of the features with the target
  
- Data Preparation
  - Feature Enginering
  - Outlier removal using IQR
  - Feature Selection
  - Scaling
  
- Modeling
  - Model selection
  - Tuning
  - Ensenble model with the best models
 
 - Evaluation
  - See how the best models perform with the test set
  - Pick the best model
  - See if it solves the business problem
  
 - Deploying
